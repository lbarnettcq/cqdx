As a CTO, you are well aware of the demand for qualified Salesforce architects, developers, and administrators. That's not surprising given IDC estimates that by 2024, there will be 4.1 million jobs for those with Salesforce talent.<br />
<br />
I am reaching out to introduce you to CloudQnect, we are a Salesforce Consulting Partner that specializes in Salesforce integrations, DevOps, DX migration, and custom development on both project and staff augmentation bases. We work with numerous North American organizations such as Capital One, ISC2, CarMax, UNOS, and Danaher, to name a few.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let's schedule a call to discuss {{{Recipient.Company}}}'s needs and determine if there is a fit. If I do not hear from you I will follow-up within the next week to schedule a call.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Make it a Great Day,<br />
Ken<br />
