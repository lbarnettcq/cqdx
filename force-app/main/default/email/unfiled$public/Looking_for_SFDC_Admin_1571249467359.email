<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hello&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
<br />
I saw that you&#39;d recently posted a job listing for a Salesforce Administrator on LinkedIn.com.&nbsp; Did you know that a Salesforce Admin&#39;s average salary is close to $100K and they have an average tenure of <i><b>less than one year</b></i>?&nbsp; Have you considered using a Salesforce Managed Services solution instead?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A few of the benefits of working with a Managed Services Team include:
<ol>
	<li>It&#39;s Cost Effective / Predictable Budget</li>
	<li>Access to a Team of Salesforce Experts</li>
	<li>Your Team Stays Focused on Your Business</li>
	<li>A Partner to Help You Grow and Scale Organically</li>
</ol>
Schedule a 15-minute call on&nbsp;<a href="https://calendly.com/ahuneycutt-cloudqnect/15min">Calendly</a>&nbsp;to learn more.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
