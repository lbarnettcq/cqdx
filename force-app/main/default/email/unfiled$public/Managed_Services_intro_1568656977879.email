Recently, I attended a conference where three CTOs discussed how they focus their teams and manage their jobs. The take-away was they each focus on the strategic services, software, and technology that helps them support their respective company&#39;s goals. They all said the key is to know what and why to outsource. It was best summed up when one of the panelist said, &quot;in the end you have to ask yourself, who is going to do it better?&quot;<br />
<br />
When you look at your use of Salesforce what is the best way to support your users? There are basically 3 choices:
<ol>
	<li>Hire a Salesforce Admin at, according to recruiter Mason Frank, an average salary of $98,152&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Outsource those services</li>
	<li>Or do nothing and not get the support you need.</li>
</ol>
So, &quot;who is going to support your use of Salesforce better?&quot;<br />
<br />
I&#39;d to introduce you to CloudQnect and our Salesforce Admin Managed Services. Our clients, such as TemperPack, CarMax,&nbsp; and UNOS, to name a few, rely on CloudQnect&#39;s Managed Services to help them maximize their Salesforce investment at a fraction of the cost of a full-time admin.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let&#39;s <a href="https://calendly.com/kbalog-cloudqnect/15min?back=1&month=2019-10">schedule a brief 15-minute</a> call to discuss {{{Recipient.Company}}}&#39;s needs and determine if there is a fit. If I do not hear from you I will follow-up within the next week.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Make it a Great Day,<br />
