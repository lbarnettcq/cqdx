We&#39;re reaching out because your team has shown some interest in CloudQnect&#39;s Salesforce consulting services and I wanted to be sure I reached out to all relevant stakeholders. We are a Certified Salesforce Consulting Partner with an Agile DevOps methodology at our core. We specialize in Salesforce staff augmentation and project-based opportunities and work with numerous North American companies (Capital One, CarMax, Agean Bioscience, and ISC2, to name a few) helping them implement, customize, and optimize their use of Salesforce.<br />
