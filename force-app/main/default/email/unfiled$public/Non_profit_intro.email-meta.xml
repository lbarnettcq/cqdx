Effectively using one&apos;s data is a key to success for any organization. Here is a link to a recent article about the 4 Ways to Manage Your Non-Profit Better with Data which I think you and your team would enjoy.



My name is Ken Balog with CloudQnect. We specialize in implementing, customizing, and optimizing the use of Salesfore.com within the non/not-for-profit arenas. I’m wondering if you might be open to an initial conversation to gauge a fit with {!Lead.Company}?



Let me highlight some of the results we&apos;ve helped a few of our clients achieve:


Art for the Journey and ISC2, came to us via referrals from our clients, and were struggling to get Salesforce set-up to track donations, volunteers, activities, and memberships. In both cases, we were able to help them when their current staff and prior consultants had failed. Some of the results were:




Centralized all of their data into Salesforce enabling them to share constituents across departments creating new value and better service for their members, donors, and interested parties.
Set up and customized Salesforce’s Non-Profit Cloud and Volunteer Starter Packs enabling them to create and automate customized messages, based on each member/donor’s data
Created customized website landing pages which captured website data and delivered automated messages to help engage those parties in furthering their interest in the association.
Translated all of this data into customized dashboards and automated reports for the association’s executive staff and board which improved communication and oversight
Created a customized Volunteer Self Service instance saving them time and increasing the accuracy of each volunteer’s data
Created customized continuing education tools where all data is captured in Salesforce, results are automatically tallied, and certificates sent to those who passed
Implementing Salesforce Surveys in place of SurveyMonkey which added additional details and transparency to their dashboards and reports
