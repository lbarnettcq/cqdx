As the CIO for&nbsp;{{{Recipient.Company}}} I thought this article might interest you:&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudqnect.com/cio-role-evolving/">https://cloudqnect.com/cio-role-evolving/</a>.<br />
<br />
I am reaching out to introduce you to CloudQnect, we are a registered Salesforce Consulting Partner with an Agile DevOps methodology at our core. We specialize in Salesforce DevOps, DX, integrations, and custom development projects and staff augmentation. We currently work with numerous North American companies (Dynatrace, Capital One, CarMax, Agean Bioscience, and ISC2, to name a few) helping them implement, customize, and optimize their use of Salesforce.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let's schedule a brief 15-minute call to discuss {{{Recipient.Company}}}'s needs and determine if there is a fit. Would it be ok for me to send over a few potential meeting times?<br />
<br />
Thanks and Make it a Great Day,<br />
Ken<br />
